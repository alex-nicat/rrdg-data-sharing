  - ~~Registries having their reporting periods in local time .. problem? (such as .at, for example)~~ See #2
  - ~~Specify ISO8601 usage for date/time further?~~ See #3

  - ~~Monthtly files - can they include "half" months? And can daily files include "half days"? "incomplete" reporting periods - are those possible? What does that mean for "start" and "end"? ~~ See #5
