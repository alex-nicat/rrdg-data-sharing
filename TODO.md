# TODOs & open issues

  - Agree on a licence for the spec / eventual software
  - Create final specification
  - Create implementations on both ends (giving / receiving)
  - Registries having their reporting periods in local time .. problem? (such as .at, for example)
  - Specify ISO8601 usage for date/time further?
  - BOM? File does not contain non-ascii info, do we need it?
  - Monthtly files - can they include "half" months? And can daily files include "half days"? "incomplete" reporting periods - are those possible? What does that mean for "start" and "end"? 
  - should the file name also contain registrar/client identification?
  - Shall we allow additional, non-standard columns?
  - URL structure - seperate for monthly / daily, or use a query parameter?

# Nice to have & Ideas

  - Create JSON format as alternative to CSV
  - Allow localization of CSV ("german" Excel compatibility?)
